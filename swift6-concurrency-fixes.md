# Swift 6 Concurrency Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. OptimizedPromptService.swift
**Original Error**: Lines 292 and 357 had errors about non-Sendable `[Prompt]` arrays being returned from DataStore.fetch

**Fix Applied**: 
- Line 292: Changed direct array access to store the result in a local variable first
- Line 357: Renamed the variable from `prompts` to `fetchedPrompts` to avoid shadowing

### 2. PromptService.swift
**Original Error**: Line 401 had errors about:
- Sending 'prompt' risks causing data races
- AIAnalysis not conforming to Sendable protocol

**Fix Applied**:
- Extracted Sendable values from the prompt before passing to MainActor closure
- Changed the return type from `AIAnalysis` to `AIAnalysisDTO` (which is Sendable)
- Created the AIAnalysis object from the DTO after receiving it from MainActor

### 3. AIAnalysis.swift
**Original Issue**: AIAnalysis class needed to be made Sendable

**Finding**: SwiftData `@Model` classes cannot conform to Sendable protocol due to mutable stored properties. This is a known limitation of SwiftData.

**Solution**: Used existing DTO pattern (AIAnalysisDTO) which is already Sendable for cross-actor communication.

## Key Learnings

1. SwiftData models (`@Model`) cannot be made Sendable directly
2. Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) that conform to Sendable when passing data across actor boundaries
3. Extract values from non-Sendable types before passing them to isolated contexts
4. The codebase already has a good pattern with DTOs for this purpose

## Remaining Work

The other concurrency errors in the codebase (MemoryMappedStore.swift, HybridContentStore.swift, MappedFile.swift) were not part of this request and remain to be addressed.
